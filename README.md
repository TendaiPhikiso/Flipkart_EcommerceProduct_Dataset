## Data Quality Issues 
######  A data quality assessment is a process of evaluating data and measuring it against selected quality criteria such as completeness and validity.

This analysis was conducted using the Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Documentation provided by  Danalytics ‚û°Ô∏è [Link to Danalytics Channel](https://youtu.be/T0yspXF3onU). The DQA served as a valuable resource for recording and identifying issues within the Flipkart dataset. 

Here is a summary of the key issues:
- Missing Values
- Duplicate Records
- Irrelevant Information in a Column
