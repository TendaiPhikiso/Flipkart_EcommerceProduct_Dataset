## Data Quality Issues 
######  A data quality assessment is a process of evaluating data and measuring it against selected quality criteria such as completeness and validity.

This analysis was conducted using the Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Documentation provided by  Danalytics ➡️ [Link to Danalytics Channel](https://youtu.be/T0yspXF3onU). The DQA served as a valuable resource for recording and identifying issues within the Flipkart dataset. 

Here is a summary of the key issues identified:
- Missing Values
- Duplicate Records
- Inaccessible data
- Irrelevant Information in a Column
