## Data Quality Issues 
######  A data quality assessment is a process of evaluating data and measuring it against selected quality criteria such as completeness and validity.

This analysis was conducted using the Data Quality Assessment (DQA) Documentation provided by  Danalytics ‚û°Ô∏è [Link to Danalytics Channel](https://youtu.be/T0yspXF3onU). The DQA served as a valuable resource for recording and identifying issues within the Flipkart dataset. 

Here is a summary of the key issues:
- Missing Values
- Duplicate Records
- Inaccessible data
- Irrelevant Information in a Column

## Next Steps
The next steps involve implementing the proposed solutions in the DQA to clean the dataset as well as taking note of any data quality issues identified within the process.
