#### 📊 Situation: 
I was recently assigned a project by Danalytics with the primary objective of identifying and addressing data quality issues using the Flipkart product dataset.

#### Who’s Flipkart?

Flipkart is India's leading e-commerce platform that offers a wide range of products from smartphones, laptops, appliances, furniture, beauty, books and more.

---
#### 📊 Task:  
My task was to asses the quality of data available for analysis along with documenting any issues found. 

#### Why is this important? 
Its important as it will help uncover how suitable the data is for analysis. If left unaddressed , we risk basing our analysis on inaccurate or incomplete information, leading to unreliable insights and decisions.

---
#### 📊 Action:

- Data Collection: The data used within this project was sourced from Kaggle.

- Data Exploration: Using Excel Power Query, I generated a data profile to examine each attribute within the dataset.

- Documentation: A DQA(Data Quality Assessment) framework was implemented, establishing key metrics to assess the quality of the given data. This documentation serves as a foundation for accurate analysis and decision-making.

#### 📊 Results: 

As a result, I was able to identify missing values of about 0.69% within the entire dataset, duplicate records, Inaccessible data as well as irrelevant columns/information that cannot be used for analysis.

###  🚀 What’s next? 🚀

Exciting times ahead! Stay tuned as I dive into implementing the proposed solutions outlined in the DQA to optimize the dataset for analysis and visualization.
